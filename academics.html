Turing students then choose additional honors CS electives, as well as department-wide CS electives.</p><p>Students take honors classes covering data structures, discrete mathematics, computer architecture, operating systems, and algorithms, typically in the first two years.</p><p>Over the course of their core, students build a web crawler and search engine, a basic compiler, a pipelined processor in Verilog, an operating system kernel with preemptive multithreading and virtual memory, a driver for the real ext2 file system, and much more.</p><h3><a href="https://turing.painful.systems/faculty.html">» World-class faculty</a></h3><p>Honors classes are taught by faculty who work at the cutting-edge of computer science and who have demonstrated excellence in teaching.</p><h3>Research</h3><p>Turing Scholars are encouraged to begin undergraduate research as early as possible, and we have created many programs and events to facilitate such research.</p><p>Turing Scholars complete an honors thesis as part of their degree through a research project with a member of our faculty. During the second semester of their freshmen year, students take a course about conducting research in computer science. This course introduces the department's research faculty and their research interests.</p><h4><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Directed Reading Program (DiRP)</span></h4><p>Every semester, the Turing Scholars Student Association organizes a program called the CS Directed Reading Program (DiRP). Upperclassmen and graduate students who have done research in a particular subfield apply and are selected to serve as mentors for students interested in it. Reading Groups will meet each week to discuss papers and other sources to further students’ understanding of the group’s topic. Group mentors also serve as advisors when applying to certain labs. This allows Turing Scholars, as well as the overall UTCS community, to get more comfortable with the process of research.</p><h4>Faculty Research Talks</h4><p>Every week, a faculty member is invited to present their research to Turing Scholars. These allow students to interact with faculty outside of the classroom, learn more about the various specializations in CS, and find an interesting problem for their undergraduate thesis.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://turing.painful.systems/tags/about/">About Turing</a></li></ul></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://turing.painful.systems/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://turing.painful.systems/why-turing.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Why Turing?</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://turing.painful.systems/student-lif.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Student Life </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://turing.painful.systems/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><strong>Turing Scholars Honors Program at the University of Texas at Austin</strong></p><p>© (C) 2022 Turing Scholars Student Association</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

Spring visitors will need to visit a traditional, rather than an honors, class. Note that during the spring semester, priority is given to admitted students.</p><p><a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/admissions/schedule-visit" class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot=""><span class="link-annotation-unknown-block-id-1621193210">Please visit the CS website for more information and to schedule a tour.</span></a></p><hr><h2><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">How do I apply?</span></h2><p>High school seniors can apply to the Turing Scholars Honors Program alongside the standard UT Austin application, as long as they select computer science as either their first- or second-choice major. The honors application process includes short-answer questions and an expanded resume and can be completed within the ApplyTexas/Coalition portal or on UT Austin's MyStatus page after submission of the UT application.</p><p>The admissions comittee is looking for highly motivated students with strong math and science backgrounds. A demonstrated interest in computer science through classes or personal projects is a plus, and evidence of leadership as exhibited by significant extracurricular involvement is also helpful.</p><p>For more information about applying to freshman honors, visit the <a href="https://admissions.utexas.edu/apply/freshman-honors" class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot=""><span class="link-annotation-unknown-block-id--882406885">Texas Admissions page</span></a>.</p><h2><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">For Current UT Students</span></h2><p>If you are interested in joining the Turing Scholars Honors Program and have excelled in your current CS and math courses at UT, please consider the following options:</p><h6>Join the Turing Scholars program</h6><p>Current computer science majors can apply for admission to the Turing Scholars Honors Program at the end of each semester by submitting an <a href="https://utexas.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_6roHP2CPrgWJtmR" class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot=""><span class="link-annotation-unknown-block-id--1558725779">online application</span></a> and then emailing a resume to the address on the online application.</p><h6>Enroll in individual honors courses</h6><p>Our computer science honors courses typically have a limited number of spaces available for non-Turing Scholars. Enrollment in honors courses is particularly useful for students who wish to transfer into the Turing Scholars Program, since they give the admissions committee an excellent way to evaluate your potential.</p><p>To apply, you should submit a separate <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate/academics/advising/forms" class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot=""><span class="link-annotation-unknown-block-id-905944319">request</span></a> for each CS honors course that you wish to take, since the decisions are made by the individual faculty members who teach the course. In some cases, faculty may ask you to also make an appointment for an interview.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 7, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://turing.painful.systems/tags/about/">About Turing</a></li></ul></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://turing.painful.systems/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://turing.painful.systems/student-lif.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Student Life</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://turing.painful.systems/honors-core.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Honors Core </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://turing.painful.systems/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><strong>Turing Scholars Honors Program at the University of Texas at Austin</strong></p><p>© (C) 2022 Turing Scholars Student Association</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

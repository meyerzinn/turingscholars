And our program's small size allows us</p><ol><li>to offer stimulating and challenging honors courses that even small private schools cannot offer,</li><li>to provide significant faculty contact and guidance, and</li><li>to foster a supportive community in which students learn from each other and inspire each other.</li></ol><p>In short, our program is designed to encourage students to do truly amazing things, both during their college career and beyond.</p><h2>Benefits</h2><h3>Community</h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://resilient-sing-a1b.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F86ac4f34-20d3-4880-909c-d0c3bc5f9f6d%2FDSC_0103.jpg?table=block&amp;id=9e7c8a16-2e43-4ce1-b94a-ed6abafb8e6e&amp;spaceId=0abb7c3e-d22c-4aec-9dbc-25db245630b8&amp;width=2000&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>One of the most important aspects of our program is our community. Turing Scholars bond and make lifelong friends by taking small challenging honors courses as a cohort. This bonding is facilitated by small honors class sizes—typically 30-60—at a time when CS class sizes around the country are booming, even at small private schools. Students also have many opportunities to get to know faculty, and students can form particularly strong relationships with faculty through undergraduate research. This close-knit community extends beyond the classroom, as the Turing Scholars Student Association organizes regular events, such as brunches with professors, potlucks, and excursions into the city.</p><h3>Austin</h3><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://resilient-sing-a1b.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe390e998-b4fe-4403-9406-621400196d53%2Fryan-duffy-jBghupTmaNQ-unsplash.jpg?table=block&amp;id=ee338304-bb07-42cb-a9c5-ae5b8316f4b7&amp;spaceId=0abb7c3e-d22c-4aec-9dbc-25db245630b8&amp;width=2000&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Photo via Unsplash" width="673" height="378"></figure><p>Austin is a vibrant city that has been the fastest-growing major metropolitan area in the US for nine straight years. With its young, well-educated population, its booming tech industry, and its bustling music and cultural scene, Austin serves as a great backdrop for a college experience.</p><h3>Honors Housing</h3><p>In their first year at UT, most Turing Scholars choose to live in UT's Honors Living Community, comprised of the four halls in the Honors Quad (Andrews, Blanton, Carothers, and Littlefield) and populated by students from UT's various honors programs. Thus, the Honors Dorms allow Turing Scholars to form ties with some of the university's most talented students.</p><h3><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Undergraduate Research Opportunities</span></h3><p>An important component of the Turing Scholars degree is an undergraduate honors thesis, which is structured like a miniature PhD thesis, with a faculty advisor who helps shape and guide the research and a committee of faculty members that approves the thesis based on the student's written thesis and oral presentation. While not always publishable, the thesis is intended to be a significant piece of work that is typically conducted over two or more semesters. The honors thesis is often a student's most meaningful component of their college career, and beyond the technical depth required, the experience helps students develop a host of important life skills, including critical thinking, written and oral communication, and organizational and executive skills.</p><h3><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Career Opportunities</span></h3><p>Turing Scholars are highly sought after by industry. For example, freshman internships in the tech industry are rare, but with our aggressive first-year CS curriculum and our program's stellar reputation, about 75% of our freshmen find summer internships in the tech industry.</p><p>Our most recent poll, conducted in 2019, shows that across our freshmen, sophomores and juniors, salaries for summer internships ranged from $20/hour to $95/hour, with a median salary of $50/hour. The same poll showed that the average compensation upon graduation was $148K (including stock grants but excluding signing bonuses).</p><p>Our students who choose to pursue a PhD have enjoyed a tremendous record of placement in the top 10 PhD programs.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://turing.painful.systems/tags/about/">About Turing</a></li></ul></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://turing.painful.systems/academics.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Academics </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://turing.painful.systems/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><strong>Turing Scholars Honors Program at the University of Texas at Austin</strong></p><p>© (C) 2022 Turing Scholars Student Association</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

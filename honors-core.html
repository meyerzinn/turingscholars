Students complete a set of diverse and challenging programming projects, such as building a basic search engine or building a basic genetic algorithm to play Tetris.</p><p>Topics include: Java, object oriented programming, programming techniques, debugging, algorithm analysis, stacks, queues, linked lists, recursion, sorting, trees, hash tables, balanced trees, priority queue, graphs</p><h3><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">C S 311H: Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science</span></h3><p>Students are taught how to think mathematically and write proofs. Students are exposed to the fundamentals of Computer Science theory, such as graph theory, combinatorics, and mathematical induction. They learn to express problems mathematically and formally reason about computer science phenomena. Students are also exposed to automated theorem provers, and modern tools programmers use to reason about their program’s correctness formally.</p><p>Topic Include: Proofs, Set Theory, Number Theory, Graph Theory, Combinatorics, Induction, Contradiction, Recursion, Automated Theorem Provers, Master Theorem</p><h3><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">C S 429H: Computer Organization and Architecture</span></h3><p>Students learn about how a computer works - from transistors and logic gates to the compiler level - and how hardware and software work together. This is an intensive project based class in which, from scratch, students write a pipelined architecture in Verilog (a popular Hardware Design Language). Students are also taught C in this class as only prior knowledge of Java is assumed. Additionally students are required to blackbox test all projects and are responsible for writing clear efficient code to this end. Papers corresponding to particular projects are read and discussed. The class includes a capstone small group project where students are expected to build on a class project in novel ways.</p><p>Topics Include: Transistors, Logic Gates, Logic Diagrams, Processor Diagrams, Compilation, Thread Contexts, ISA Construction, Pipelining, Super Scalar, Cache Coherency, Atomics</p><h3><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">C S 439H: Principles of Computer Systems</span></h3><p>Students learn the building blocks of modern operating systems. They build a monolithic kernel from scratch in individual projects. Additionally they read relevant systems papers to enhance their understanding of why certain systems were developed the way they were.</p><p>Students learn to black and white box test each component of an operating system. They are assessed on the quality of their code as well as the novelty of their approach.</p><p>The class includes a final capstone class project, where the entire class works to build a fully functional operating system with graphics, sound, terminal interfaces etc. Students define their own standards and practices and rely on the faculty only when they encounter significant difficulty with a particular operating system concept. Generally this class is taught in C++ with a bit of Rust sprinkled in.</p><p>Topics Include: Threads, Processes, Synchronization Primitives, File Systems, Virtual Memory, Page Caches, Heap, Syscalls, fork and exec, Elf-Loading</p><h3>C S 331H: Algorithms and Complexity</h3><p>Students learn fundamental algorithms and complexity theory. This course is heavily proof-based and focuses on theory. Topics covered include dynamic programming, graph theory, and complexity theory. This class includes both a mathematical discovery of algorithms and the application of such techniques to code.</p><p>Topics Include: Dynamic Programming, Interval Scheduling, The Knapsack Problems, Path Finding, Max Flow, Algorithm Analysis, Complexity Analysis, Probabilistic Algorithms</p><h3>C S 178H: Introduction to CS Research</h3><p>This course helps students make the transition from classroom learning to the type of faculty-advised independent learning that is necessary to complete an honors thesis. This class gives students concrete advice about how to start researching with professors at UT, and offers practice and hands-on experience with the mechanics of research at the undergraduate and graduate level.</p><p>Topics Include: The research Process, Academic Reading and Writing, Graduate School, graduate school applications, the trajectory of an academic career, the role of research in industry, road to the Turing thesis.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 6, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://turing.painful.systems/tags/about/">About Turing</a></li></ul></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://turing.painful.systems/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://turing.painful.systems/admissions.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Admissions</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://turing.painful.systems/faculty.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Honors Faculty </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://turing.painful.systems/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><strong>Turing Scholars Honors Program at the University of Texas at Austin</strong></p><p>© (C) 2022 Turing Scholars Student Association</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
